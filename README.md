# üõí Inventory Tracking System

A scalable, secure, and efficient backend system to manage inventory for single and multi-store kiryana operations ‚Äî designed for Bazaar Technologies' case study challenge.

---

## üì¶ Project Overview

This system enables product stock-in, sales, manual removals, and store-specific inventory tracking. It evolves across three stages:

- **Stage 1:** Local inventory tracking for a single store
- **Stage 2:** REST API with PostgreSQL for 500+ stores
- **Stage 3:** Scalable architecture for thousands of stores with async updates, caching, and auditing

---

## ‚úÖ Features by Stage

### Stage 1: Single Store Support
- CLI & REST API support
- Local data modeling with `Product`, `StockMovement`, and `Store`
- Basic stock-in, sell, and remove operations

### Stage 2: Multi-Store System
- RESTful APIs for all entities
- Store-specific inventory tracking
- PostgreSQL integration
- Basic Authentication (Spring Security)
- Request Throttling (via Bucket4j)
- Filtering & reporting support via APIs

### Stage 3: Scalable & Event-Driven
- Event-driven updates with Spring `@EventListener`
- API rate-limiting via Bucket4j
- Audit trail through `StockMovement` history
- Prepared for horizontal scalability (e.g., microservices, read/write DBs)
- Extendable for caching using Redis (not yet integrated)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Bucket4j** (rate-limiting)
- **Maven**

---

## üß± Entity Design

- `Product`: Holds product catalog info
- `Store`: Represents an individual store
- `StockMovement`: Logs inventory changes (stock-in, sale, manual)
- `User`: Handles access control and roles

---

## üîê Security

- Basic Authentication using Spring Security
- Users must log in to access core APIs

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Rate Limiting

- Implemented via Bucket4j
- Limits per endpoint/IP to prevent abuse

---

## üì¨ Event-Driven Architecture

- `StockUpdateEvent` + `StockUpdateListener` ensure async inventory syncing
- Makes the system ready for distributed, decoupled environments

---

## üìä Reporting & Filtering

APIs support filtering by:
- Store
- Product
- Date range
- Quantity thresholds

---

## üìÇ API Endpoint Reference


### üåê Base URL

When running locally, all API requests should be made to:

http://localhost:8081


Example:
(GET http://localhost:8081/api/products)


Make sure the server is running on port `8081`. If you've changed it, update your request URLs accordingly.
